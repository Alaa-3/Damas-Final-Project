            <h2>why Damascus?</h2>
            <h3>Damascus, the city of Jasmine</h3>
            <p>
              It is colloquially known in Syria as ash-Sham and titled the City of Jasmine. In
              addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world,
              Damascus is a major cultural centre of the Levant and the Arab world. The city has an
              estimated population of 1,711,000 as of 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is Damascus known as the City of Jasmine?
              <br />
              Although the most fragrant of roses bears the name rosa damascena, Damascus rose, the
              Syrian capital is known as Madinat Al Yasmine, the City of Â­Jasmine. Each fall it
              holds a festival in homage of this national flower, with people giving each other
              stems of jasmine and decorating their home with fragrant blossoms. It was even held in
              recent years, despite the conflict that left thousands dead and millions displaced,
              with flowers given to those who lost loved ones.

                <h4>Al Azem Palace</h4>
                <p>
                  The palace was built during the Ottoman era over the former site of a Mamluk
                  palace as a residence for the governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm during the
                  reign of Sultan Mahmud I. Serving as a joint residence and guesthouse, the palace
                  was a monument to 18th-century Arab architecture. The palace was built by 800
                  workers in a span of three years, and the building was decorated with highly
                  sophisticated and expensive decorative elements.

                  Architecture is an excellent example of Damascene traditional houses. The
                  structure consists of several buildings and three wings

                <h4>Mount Qasioun</h4>
                <p>
                  Mount Qasioun is a mountain overlooking the city of Damascus, Syria. It has a
                  range of restaurants, from which the whole city can be viewed. As the city has
                  expanded over the years, some districts have been established at the foot of the
                  mountain. Its highest point is 1,151 metres.

                <p>
                  The term Qasioun might mean "hard and dry" in Syriac language, which is the
                  characteristic of the bare rocky mountain that has no grass, greenery, or water.

                <p>
                  Khan As'ad Pasha is the largest caravanserai in the Old City of Damascus, covering
                  an area of 2,500 square metres. Situated along Al-Buzuriyah Souq, it was built and
                  named after As'ad Pasha al-Azm, the governor of Damascus

                <p>
                  The design of the khan included eight small domes and one large central opening
                  reminiscent of Persian architecture, while the eight domes reflect Shia tradition.
                  The covered courtyard features a high ceiling height which helped provide
                  protection from the climate during the hot summer and cold winter seasons
