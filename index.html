            <h3>Damascus, the city of Jasmine</h3>
            <p>
              It is colloquially known in Syria as ash-Sham and titled the City of Jasmine. In
              addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world,
              Damascus is a major cultural centre of the Levant and the Arab world. The city has an
              estimated population of 1,711,000 as of 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is Damascus known as the City of Jasmine?
              <br />
              Although the most fragrant of roses bears the name rosa damascena, Damascus rose, the
              Syrian capital is known as Madinat Al Yasmine, the City of Â­Jasmine. Each fall it
              holds a festival in homage of this national flower, with people giving each other
              stems of jasmine and decorating their home with fragrant blossoms. It was even held in
              recent years, despite the conflict that left thousands dead and millions displaced,
              with flowers given to those who lost loved ones.
